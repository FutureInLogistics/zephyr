      Divides the kernel clock giving the time quanta clock that is fed to the
      CAN core(FDCAN_CKDIV).
      Note that the divisor is common to all 'st,stm32-fdcan' instances.
      Divide by 1 is the peripherals reset value and remains set unless
      this property is configured.

  timestamp-counter:
    type: phandle
    required: false
    description: |
      Phandle to the counter device to be used as the external rx timestamp
      source (CAN_MCAN_TSCC_TSS=10) if CONFIG_CAN_RX_TIMESTAMP is enabled.
